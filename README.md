Credit Card Fraud Detection & Analysis
An end-to-end project leveraging machine learning and business intelligence to detect and analyze credit card fraud using synthetic transactional data.

 Objective
To identify fraudulent credit card transactions through predictive modeling and explore patterns using interactive data visualizations.

 Project Structure
Fraud detection.ipynb – Contains the full ML pipeline: preprocessing, EDA, modeling, and evaluation.

synthetic_fraud_dataset.csv – Synthetic dataset mimicking real-world credit card transactions.

Financial Fraud Analysis.pbix – Power BI dashboard for fraud insights and stakeholder reporting.

Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Power BI

Jupyter Notebook

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

ML Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.

 Power BI Dashboard Highlights
Fraud Cases Over Time – Line chart showing monthly fraud trends.

Monthly Fraud Count by Location – Compare cities with the highest fraud activity.

Fraudulent Transactions by Device Type – Understand what devices are most exploited.

Fraud Rate by Transaction Type – Donut chart with interactive filters.

Risk Score Funnel – Visual comparison of fraud risk across transaction types.

Interactive Filters – Location, month, transaction type slicers built-in for dynamic analysis.

Machine Learning Pipeline
EDA: Identified data imbalance and behavioral anomalies.

Feature Engineering: Risk-based features (e.g., device flags, transaction distance).

Modeling: Trained multiple classifiers; tuned with cross-validation.

Evaluation: Used accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score.

Result: Achieved strong performance with <model_name> model (e.g., 97% recall).

 Key Insights
Most fraud occurred on mobile/tablet devices.

ATM withdrawals had the highest fraud rate.

London and Tokyo had the highest volume of monthly fraud.

Fraud spikes observed in March and August.

 What I Learned
Combining ML with BI tools to create a complete data science pipeline.

Translating complex fraud patterns into digestible visuals for stakeholders.

Building impactful dashboards using custom measures (DAX) and interactivity.
